# Getting Started with Create React App

Podcaster App is a web application that allows you to discover and listen music podcasts. With this app you can choose from Apple's 100 most popular podcasts, learn a little about each of them and listen to their episodes.

The application is a SPA where we find a main view of all available podcasts. This view offers a text filter where we can filter podcasts by name or description. By clicking on any of them, we can access a detail view, where we will find its name and description along with a list of available episodes, their release date and duration. To listen to an episode, just click on it.
